## Integration with _DOTEbase_

_DOTEbase_ is our new software package that is designed to support qualitative analysis of large audio-visual data sets.

We built it because we wanted a software tools to help researchers to analyse larger corpora of data, either before they have been transcribed or after.

It piggybacks on sets of transcripts created using _DOTE_ that are stored on the same computer or are accessible via an external drive or remote file system.

To use _DOTEbase_, you will need to purchase a license for _DOTE_ from our webshop.

To be able to use _DOTEbase_, you must update _DOTE_ to at least v1.1.0+.
See the help guide for how to install and use DOTEbase.

The main changes to _DOTE_ are as follows:

1. Support for creating, viewing and deleting Transcript Clips in the Transcript panel.
2. Support for importing and exporting Transcripts and Projects with Transcript Clips.
3. Support for importing and exporting Projects with Media Clips.
4. Support for tracking changes to Transcript Clips in Checkpoints and Autobackups.

Note that Media Clips are not viewable in _DOTE_, only in _DOTEbase_, but the data is stored in each Project.

Note that when a Project/Transcript is open in _DOTE_ the same Transcript in a DOTEspace in _DOTEbase_ will be locked so that it cannot be edited in two places at the same time, which would lead to conflicts.
As soon as a different Transcript is opened in _DOTE_, the previous Transcript will be unlocked in _DOTEbase_, so the relevant clips can be edited again in _DOTEbase_.

Note that users of the Free edition of _DOTE_ will only be able to view Transcript Clips that others have made and shared with them.
They will not be able create nor edit Transcript Clips.
A purchased license will be necessary.
