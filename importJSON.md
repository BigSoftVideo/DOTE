## Import transcript from 3rd party sources (JSON file)

It is possible to import a transcript generated by 3rd party software, such as another transcription tool or speech recognition software.
We only directly support MacWhisper at present, which can export a transcript in the following format.

For reference, the JSON file that is to be imported into DOTE should take the following form:

```
{
	"lines": [ // An array of JSON objects
		{
			"startTime": string;  		"00:00:00.000"   	// hour:min:sec:millisecond
			"endTime": string; 		"00:00:00.000"   	// hour:min:sec:millisecond
			"speakerDesignation":		"Speaker 1"		// Some unique designation of the speaker of the given line of text
			"text":string;			"The line of text"
		}
	]
}
```
