## Import transcript from 3rd party sources (JSON file)

It is possible to import a transcript generated by 3rd party software, such as another transcription tool or speech recognition software.
We only directly support [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) at present, which can export a transcript in the correct JSON format suitable for DOTE.
See the MacWhisper website for more details.
Currently, MacWhisper only works on macOS (and not all OS versions).
A Windows version is forthcoming.
Note that _DOTE_ has no relationship to Whisper code development, nor does it offer speech recognition internally.

To initiate the import, select ``Import Transcript from JSON`` from the `File` menu.

After selecting a file from your computer, if the JSON format is not recognised, then an error will be given.

There are two options when importing the file:
1. Remove punctuation from the text strings.
2. Remove capitalisation from the initial character on each line (if present).

The transcript will be imported into the currently open Transcript, so if you wish to import into a blank Transcript, then use `New Transcript` from the `File` menu.

For reference, the JSON file that is to be imported into DOTE should take the following form:

```
{
	"lines": [      // An array of JSON objects
		{
			"startTime": string;            "00:00:00.000"          // hour:min:sec:millisecond
			"endTime": string;              "00:00:00.000"          // hour:min:sec:millisecond
			"speakerDesignation": string;   "Speaker 1"             // Some unique designation of the speaker of the given line of text
			"text": string;                 "The line of text"
		}
	]
}
```
