## How student assistants can use _DOTE_ to transcribe

[_DOTE_](README.md) is our new software package that we are developing at Aalborg University to better support transcription of 2D and 360 video data.

To install _DOTE_ and the Project you will be working on, you will receive and/or download several zipped files:

1. The installation package for Windows or Mac.
Unzip and follow the [instructions](install.md) to install _DOTE_.
You will need a serial key to continue using _DOTE_.
To use Checkpoints you will also need to install some software called _Git_ on your computer.
See the [instructions for your operating system](install.md).
1. The DOTE-Lego demo project.
There is a [demo project](demo.md) with multiple videos and transcripts showing off some of the features of _DOTE_.
Download and [import the Project](import.md) into _DOTE_.

### How to get started on a transcription

- Read the [instructions here](projects.md) to see how Transcripts and Projects are organised.
You can skip most of the instructions since you are unlikely to be required to create a new project yourself.
- [Import the Project](import.md) that you have been sent (if you are to work on a Transcript with some media data).
- Follow the [help guide](help.md) to learn how to use _DOTE_.
- Look at the hints about [How to Transcribe](howto.md).
- Remember to save your changes frequently.
- Use the [checkpoint system](versioncontrol.md) to bookmark the changes you have made, so that the researchers can follow what work you have done.
It is best to make a checkpoint after a coherently meaningful set of changes, eg. you added 10 new lines of transcript _or_ you checked and corrected all of the overlaps or pauses in a section of the transcript.
If you keep making checkpoints as your transcription work progresses, then a meaningful history of changes will be created.

### Sharing the transcription work you have done

When you need to send your transcription work back to the researcher, then you only need to [Export Transcript](import.md) and send them the file created, as long as they have a _DOTE_ project with the video clip.

Warning: If your computer breaks and is not recoverable, then you will lose all the editing in _DOTE_ since the last time you sent it by email, so send a copy frequently and/or backup your _DOTE_ project to an external drive.

### Receiving a _DOTE_ transcript from someone

If you receive a _DOTE_ transcript from someone, eg. with comments and revisions, then you need to [import it](import.md) into the same Project as your own Transcripts.

### IMPORTANT

- Do _not_ share _DOTE_ or the transcription project data with anybody.
Both must be deleted from your computer after your work has been completed.
The data in the project may be sensitive and you will have to comply with any rules and regulations (GDPR) concerning your access to the data for the purposes of transcription.
- We are using a channel `#dote-beta` on our [workspace on Slack](https://bigvideo.slack.com) to share ideas and experiences quickly, and to fix issues interactively with other users and the developers.
You need to get an invite from us to join this channel.
It is just like using `WhatsApp` or `Discord` for private groups.
- If you are having any problems with _DOTE_ or you have an idea how to improve how it works, then let us know in the Slack channel.
You can also ask questions about transcription as well.
