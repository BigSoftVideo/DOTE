## Demo project

If this is your first time, we would like you to try out _DOTE_ using our demo LEGO project.
The demo project is freely available under a [Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0 (CC BY-NC-SA) International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode) license.
The [original data](https://doi.org/10.5278/ojs.quivirr.v1.2020.a0003) is published online.
We make no claim that the demo transcripts are authoritative or complete; they are simple illustrative of some of the core functionality of _DOTE_.

### Here are some instructions to import the Demo Project

1. Download the latest demo Project file `Lego Demo Project.doteProject` from GitHub, and store it somewhere on your computer.
It is in the same online location as the _DOTE_ [release](https://github.com/BigSoftVideo/DOTE/releases).
1. Open _DOTE_ and select `File ➔ Import Project from File`.
1. Locate the Project file that you downloaded (with the extension `.doteProject`) on your file system and click `Open`.
1. Select a destination directory/folder by clicking `Select Directory`.
For example, a folder in your `Documents` called `My DOTE Projects`.
1. Enter a name for your imported Demo Project or select the default name.
1. After you have imported the Project, you can open one of the Demo Transcripts in that Project using `Open Transcript` or `File ➔ Open Transcript` or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> [or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> on macOS].
Locate and select the `Lego Transcript Jeffersonian` or the `Lego Transcript Mondadaian` subfolder in the Project folder that you created in an earlier step.
1. The [DOTE project](projects.md) should open and you will see the waveform, video and prepared Transcript.

NOTE: Do _not_ store the Demo Project in the same folder tree as the DOTE application itself.
Please see the [_Where to store your DOTE projects?_](projects.md#storing) help section for more information on solving issues when using remote folders (Windows) and volumes (macOS) for storing projects.

### How to try the Demo

1. You can [play through the video](video.md) and check the two partial [Transcripts](transcript.md) that have already been made according to Jeffersonian and Mondadaian [conventions](conventions.md).
1. The Transcripts already have some [sync-codes](sync-code.md) and [video-cues](cues.md) that should work automatically when you play the video or click on the sync-code either in the appropriate [timeline](timeline.md) or the editor panel (sync-codes).
Try them.
1. Try some of the _DOTE_ functionality:
    - Try the [playback controls](play.md) and [looping](timeline.md).
    - Edit the [transcript](transcript.md), type some text and transcription symbols.
    - Add speakers and see how _DOTE_ autocompletes.
    - Add [sync-codes](sync-code.md) and [video-cues](cues.md).
    - Peek at [checkpoints and autosaves](versioncontrol.md).
    Note: You need to install `Git` first (see [Installation instructions](install.md)).
    - Create your own checkpoint after making some changes.
1. If you make changes, remember to save the Transcript regularly `File ➔ Save Transcript` or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> [or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> on macOS].
