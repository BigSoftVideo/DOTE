## How to find the logfile

Each time _DOTE_ is opened, a new logfile is created. The filename shows the date (`year-month-day`) and time
(`hour-minute-second`) of creation. When attaching a logfile to a bugreport, select the one
that was created just before you experienced the bug, or attach multiple logfiles if unsure.

The correct log folder can be opened from the _DOTE_ `Help` menu.
The screenshot below shows what might be contained within that folder.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the folder manually as follows.
