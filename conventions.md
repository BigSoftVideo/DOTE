*DOTE* largely agrees closely a standardised set of transcription conventions in conversation analysis based on Gail Jefferson's innovations for a script-based system.
There is an up-to-date [specification of the Jeffersonian-style conventions supported in *DOTE*](jefferson.md) with additional notes.

*DOTE* also fully supports an extended set of transcription conventions for multimodal subtier alignment script-based system with some modifications, namely a system developed by Lorenza Mondada.
There is an up-to-date [specification of the Mondadaian-style conventions supported in *DOTE*](mondada.md) with additional notes.

The default conventions for every new transcript can be set in [Settings](settings.md).
For each transcript, the appropriate transcript conventions can be selected in [Transcript Options](settings.md#options) (to override the default).
