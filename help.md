Some of the tutorials are also available as importable _DOTE_ Projects.

Use _DOTE_ to [import each Project](import.md) into your _MY DOTE PROJECTS_ folder, for example.
When you are done importing, you can just open the Transcript in the Project using `File/Open Transcript` and you will see a hyperlinked version of the video with a table of contents in the Transcript panel.
