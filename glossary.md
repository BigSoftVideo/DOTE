## Glossary of key terms in _DOTE_

Below is a list of key terms in alphabetical order with short definitions and links to relevant help pages for more information.

### Active Media <a id='active'></a>

When media files are added to a Project using the [Media Manager](media.md) they can be activated to appear in the current Transcript.
If a media file is deactivated, it will not be available for use in the current Transcript.

### Alignment Symbol

An alignment symbol (Mondadian conventions) is a unique symbol reserved for use in a transcript to indicate the temporal alignment of an action in a [subtier](tier.md) with the [HEAD](#head) of the [neighbourhood](#neighbourhood).

See [Realignment](#align).

### Autocompletion

Autocompletion is the automatic, context-sensitive prompting of possible character or symbol strings that the user can select from.
There are several aspects of a Transcript that can be autocompleted in the [Editor](transcript.md).
1. The speaker-id column.
1. Named subtier types: action, translation and gloss.
1. Special symbols and symbol pairs.
1. Overlaps.

### Media Manager

The [Media Manager](media.md) is a tool to add media files in an individual [Project](project.md).
It is used to import, configure and delete media files, as well as make them [active](#active) in the current Transcript.
A Project can contain multiple media files, and each Transcript in a Project can activate one or more of these media to use in the [Timeline](timeline.md) and [Video Panel(s)](video.md).

### Neighbourhood <a id='neighbourhood'></a>

A [Neighbourhood](tiers.md) is a concept we developed to better encapsulate what goes on during simultaneous events captured in a set of transcript lines in a [script-based transcription system](#script).
Sets of lines in a transcript can be grouped together temporally because they try to represent events that happen within a single, continuous duration in time.
Everything transcribed in a Neighbourhood occurs within that single duration of time, whether it be speech, multimodal action or events happening in the scene.
A Neighbourhood contains all those actions, sometimes in concurrent [subtiers](tiers.md), which are represented using the [Jeffersonian](jefferson.md) or [Mondadaian](mondada.md) conventions.
