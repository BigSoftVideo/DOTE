### Alignment Symbol

### Media Manager

The [Media Manager](media.md) is a tool to add media files in an individual [Project](project.md).
It is used to import, configure and delete media files, as well as make them [active](#active) in the current Transcript.
A Project can contain multiple media files, and each Transcript in a Project can activate one or more of these media to use in the [Timeline](timeline.md) and [Video Panel(s)](video.md).

### Neighbourhood <a id='neighbourhood'></a>

A [Neighbourhood](tiers.md) is a concept we developed to better encapsulate what goes on during simultaneous events captured in a set of transcript lines in a [script-based transcription system](#script).
Sets of lines in a transcript can be grouped together temporally because they try to represent events that happen within a single, continuous duration in time.
Everything transcribed in a Neighbourhood occurs within that single duration of time, whether it be speech, multimodal action or events happening in the scene.
A Neighbourhood contains all those actions, sometimes in concurrent [subtiers](tiers.md), which are represented using the [Jeffersonian](jefferson.md) or [Mondadaian](mondada.md) conventions.
