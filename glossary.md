### Neighbourhood

A [neighbourhood](tiers.md) is a concept we developed to better encapsulate what goes on during simultaneous events captured in a set of lines in a script-based transcription system.
Sets of lines can naturally be grouped together because they try to represent a single, continuous duration in time, in which events happen.
Everything transcribed in those lines occurs within that single duration of time, whether it be speech, multimodal action or events happening in the scene.
A neighbourhood contains all those actions, sometimes in concurrent [subtiers](tiers.md), which are represented using the [Jeffersonian](jefferson.md) or [Mondadaian](mondada.md) conventions.
