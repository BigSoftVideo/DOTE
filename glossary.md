### Alignment Symbol

An alignment symbol (Mondadian conventions) is a unique symbol reserved for use in the transcript to indicate the temporal alignment of an action in a [subtier](tier.md) with the HEAD of the [neighbourhood](#neighbourhood), ie. a primary speaker tier or a primary timing interval tier.

### Media Manager

The [Media Manager](media.md) is the tool to add and configure media files in an individual [Project](project.md).
It is used to import and delete media files, as well as make them [active](#active) in the current Transcript.
A Project can have multiple media files, and each Transcript in a Project can activate one or more of these media to use in the [Timeline](timeline.md) and [Video Panel(s)](video.md).

### Neighbourhood <a id='neighbourhood'></a>

A [Neighbourhood](tiers.md) is a concept we developed to better encapsulate what goes on during simultaneous events captured in a set of lines in a script-based transcription system.
Sets of lines can naturally be grouped together because they try to represent a single, continuous duration in time, in which events happen.
Everything transcribed in those lines in one Neighbourhood occurs within that single duration of time, whether it be speech, multimodal action or events happening in the scene.
A Neighbourhood contains all those actions, sometimes in concurrent [subtiers](tiers.md), which are represented using the [Jeffersonian](jefferson.md) or [Mondadaian](mondada.md) conventions.

See also HEAD.
