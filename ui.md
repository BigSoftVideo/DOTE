## User interface

The _DOTE_ user interface is comprised of several panels divided into two main sections: the left is for media control functions and the right is for transcript editor functions.
The left section (timelines, video panels) can be collapsed using the `<<` button.
This is useful when you wish to focus (in zen mode) on editing your transcript, esp. with long lines.
The right section (editor) can be collapsed using the `>>` button.
This is useful when you wish to present your video without the transcript.
The panels can be adjusted by grabbing and dragging the divider lines.
Additionally, some panels (video panels, video-cue timeline) can be hidden.
In general, the _DOTE_ window size and the position of the panels is saved between sessions.
