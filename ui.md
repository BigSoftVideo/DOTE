## User interface

The _DOTE_ user interface is comprised of several panels divided into two main sections: left and right.
The left section (timelines, video) can be collapsed using the `<<` button.
This is useful when you wish to focus on editing your transcript.
The right section (editor) can be collapsed using the `>>` button.
This is useful when you wish to present your video.
The panels can be adjusted by grabbing and dragging the divider lines.
In general, the _DOTE_ window size and the position of the panels is saved between sessions.
