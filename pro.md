## _DOTE_ vs _DOTE Pro_ and _DOTE Pro Community_

_DOTE_ is available in two versions:

1. [_DOTE_ (free)](#free) is an open build that can be installed by anyone.
One can use this to transcribe data according to both Jeffersonian and Mondadaian conventions and export to RTF ready for publication.
1. [_DOTE Pro_ (paid)](#pro) is the same software plus extra functionality.
One time payment for one license that can be installed on up to three computers.

A license is granted for access to the current release version of _DOTE Pro_, including hotfixes and minor updates (eg. from `v1.1` to `v1.2`).
With each new major release (eg. from `v1` to `v2`), a new license or an upgrade is required.

There is an additional [_DOTE Pro Community_](#community) option that gives the user exclusive access to fast-track bug reports and feature requests, as well as private access to new beta versions before release.

### _DOTE_ (free) <a id='free'></a>

The free version of _DOTE_ has the following restrictions:

- No more than XXX lines of transcription in each Transcript.
- Simple Export to RTF functionality, but with [no line numbering options](export.md#lines).
- No [Export to SRT](export.md#srt) functionality (subtitles).
- [Checkpoint and Autobackup compare mode](versioncontrol.md#compare) is not available.

Users of the free version of _DOTE_ can make official tracked bug reports on GitHub (public repository).
And there are public `Discord` channels for basic support.

### _DOTE Pro_ features <a id='pro'></a>

_DOTE Pro_ includes the following features _not_ available in the free version:

### _DOTE Pro_ license installation <a id='license'></a>

To use the full feature set of _DOTE Pro_, you will have to do the following:

1. Pay for the _DOTE Pro_ license.
1. Register and receive the license key.
1. Install the license in the latest version of _DOTE_ installed on a computer.

Notes:

- One _DOTE Pro_ license can be installed on up to three different computers (slots) owned by that user.
- If all three slots are full, then one slot will have to be unregistered so that a new computer can receive that free slot.

### _DOTE Pro Community_ upgrade <a id='community'></a>

The purchase of a _DOTE Pro Community_ full license or upgrade gives the user access to a private workspace (on GitHub) in which other members of the community and the developers/creators of the software can communicate and give feedback, share bugs, make feature requests, learn of development plans and access early beta releases.
Moreover, members of the _DOTE Pro Community_ have access to exclusive private text and voice channels on `Discord`.
