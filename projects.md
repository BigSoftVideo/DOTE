## What are _DOTE_ Projects?

A _DOTE_ Project is a folder containing all the Transcripts for a specific audio or video clip (media source).
You can give this folder a unique and informative name.
Always keep this Project folder, files and subfolders together, otherwise _DOTE_ will not be able to recover older edited versions nor underlining, sync-codes and video-cues.
Each transcript folder contains the plain `transcript.txt` file and other hidden files needed to support _DOTE_ for that specific Project.
Each transcript can be given a unique and informative name.
Each project is stored in a _DOTE_ Projects master folder.
You can decide the name of this folder and where it is located on your operating system.
You can make multiple, independent Projects in this folder.
One can also have multiple _DOTE_ Projects master folders, for example on different drives or removable media.

Note that _DOTE_ is _not_ a cloud service.
It is a desktop application that stores data on your local computer's file system.
Thus, you can edit your Transcripts _without_ being online.
_DOTE_ does not save and store every keystroke on the cloud; the user must [save](projects.md#saving) their work frequently.
To ensure that users do not lose their work, [version control](versioncontrol.md) independently supports automatic and semantic backup.

### Folder structure <a id='folders'></a>

[![Folder structure simple](images/projects/folders-simple.png)](images/projects/folders-simple.png)

For more experienced users, here is a hint about the [hidden folder structure](images/projects/folders.png) that _DOTE_ uses.

### Where to store your _DOTE_ projects? <a id='storing'></a>

It is best to keep your _DOTE_ Project folders on a hard drive or an external hard drive, perferably an SSD for fast access.
You can store all your _DOTE_ Projects under a folder, eg. `MY _DOTE_ PROJECTS`, in `My Documents`.
Or you can store them in separate locations.
_DOTE_ projects are not dependent on their current location.
They can be moved, copied and shared.

You can use a shared folder provided that it is mapped to a drive letter, eg. on Windows, the path `//shareddrive/folder` could be mapped onto the `R:` drive letter.
Then in _DOTE_ you would create new Projects and open Transcripts that were stored on the `R:` drive, eg. in `R:/folder/`.
(If you use just the shared folder path, then _DOTE_ will fail to load the video and the transcript.)
With macOS and a shared drive, then you will have to assign the shared folder using the correct path and find it under `Volumes` in Finder.

> **NOTE: On Windows systems, the default path name length is quite short. This can cause problems for _DOTE_ and [Checkpoints](versioncontrol.md) if you use many embedded subfolders. You can change the default to long path names. There are [guides online](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Jan/03/Integrating-Long-Path-Names-in-Windows-NET-Applications), which you can follow.**

#### Not recommended storage solutions <a id='bad-storage'></a>

If you are synching the drive or folder in which _DOTE_ projects will be backed up and accessible over the Internet, then you may run into trouble.
Playing media, using checkpoints, working with lots of sync-codes or very long transcripts, and switching projects/transcripts may slow down _DOTE_.
This is because all the file operations and data transfers take more time over the internet, especially if you have a slow connection or a backup server.
There is nothing _DOTE_ can do about that, so if you have problems try and switch to a local drive that is not synced over the Internet.
Or else, be very patient and expect access problems! âŒ›

For the same reason, we do NOT recommend using _icloud_ or _Dropbox_ because data will be stored in the cloud; _DOTE_ may have trouble locating files it needs or loading large files, or syncing lots of files may be too slow.
In addition, it is not a good idea to store sensitive videos and data (unencrypted) on a commercial cloud service since it will almost certainly be surveilled for unknown purposes by the company and third parties. Their bad! ðŸ‘¿

### Quick start to create a new Project with an initial Transcript <a id='new-project'></a>

[![New Project](images/projects/new-project.png)](images/projects/new-project.png)

1. Open the Project creation panel by selecting `Create Project` or by clicking on `File âž” New Project`.
1. Enter a unique name for your Project.
1. Enter a unique name for your first Transcript in this Project.
"Main" is the default suggestion.
1. Select the [conventions](conventions.md) you prefer.
You can change this in [Transcript Options](settings.md#options) later.
1. Click on `Select Folder` to select or create a parent folder where you want your _DOTE_ projects to be stored.
Once you create a Project, a new folder within the _DOTE_ Projects folder will be created with the name that you specified.
Otherwise, select an already created _DOTE_ Projects folder.
    - For example, if you named your Project "MyFirstProject" and chose `Documents/DoteProjects` for the parent folder, than your Project files will reside inside the folder `Documents/DoteProjects/MyFirstProject`.
1. Once this is done, add a media source to your Project using [Media Manager](media.md).
1. After adding and selecting a media source and saving in Media Manager, a waveform will be generated (if it hasn't already been generated).
And if the media selected is a video, then it will appear in the [video panel](video.md).

Note: The path to the current Project folder on your computer's file system is displayed in [Transcript Options](settings.md#options).
Clicking on that path will open it in your file browser.

> **NOTE: Creating a waveform when a media file is first imported or the waveform is regenerated can take time. This could take more than 5 seconds. Progress is visible as the waveform appears gradually from left to right in the timeline.**

<a id='waveform-troubles'></a>

> **NOTE: If _DOTE_ fails to generate a visual waveform, then try transcoding the audio or video file to a more common MP4 or WAV format, such as for YouTube or Vimeo.
> See the [Tips & Tricks](tips.md) for instructions how to do that using _HandBrake_, for example.
> After you have exported a transcoded video, then rename the video file and import it into the same project.
> If you give it the same name, then select `Regenerate Waveform` in the [Media Manager](media.md).
> If you return to the main editor after selecting this option, then you will see the transcript being regenerated.
> If that fails, however, then create a new project and try to import it again.
> Or see the [Installation guide](install.md) for an alternative solution using _FFmpeg_ that will generate a waveform for a wider range of audio and video formats.**

## Save a Transcript in a Project <a id='saving'></a>

1. To save the current Transcript, then select `File âž” Save Transcript` or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> [or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> on macOS.
Saving is _not_ the same as [Autosaving](versioncontrol.md#autosaving).
Saving the current Transcript writes the Transcript data to disk, while Autosaving makes a new copy and writes that to disk so the previous state can be recovered.
Autosaving does _not_ save the current Transcript automatically; that is a manual decision by the user.
It just makes a series of backup copies at regular intervals.

### Open a Transcript in a Project <a id='open-transcript'></a>

To open the last saved Transcript/Project, then just run _DOTE_.
It automatically loads the last opened Transcript if it is accessible on the file system.

To open a previously saved Transcript, then select `Open Transcript` or `File âž” Open Transcript` or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> [or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> on macOS].

To open a Transcript in a Project that is on a different drive or a mapped drive or volume, then you will need to select the drive letter in the `System Folders` panel of the `Open Transcript` panel (see below).
That drive will be opened and you can locate the correct Project folder and Transcript.

[![Open Transcript](images/projects/open-transcript.png)](images/projects/open-transcript.png)

There are several ways to navigate your Projects and Transcripts in the `Open Transcript` panel.
The panel has three vertical panes (see Figure):
- **Left/Top 1**: Common _system folders_ and drives/volumes
    - Just select to open that folder or drive/volume in the middle pane.
    - The available Transcripts are shown in the right pane.
- **Left/Centre 2**: _Bookmarks_
    - Just select a bookmark to open the bookmarked folder in the middle pane.
    - Bookmarks can be added and deleted using the icons `+` and `X`.
    - Selecting `+` adds the current folder open in the middle pane to the list.
    - A bookmarked entry can be moved up and down in the list by selecting an entry and then click and drag it to a new position in the list.
- **Left/Bottom 3**: _Recents_
    - A list of the 5 most recent Transcripts opened.
    - The recent Transcript names are highlighted on a blue background.
- **Middle 4**: Navigate the system folder hierarchy
    - This is just like the standard file/folder explorer in Windows and macOS platforms.
    - Navigate up and down the folder hierarchy.
    - Results are shown in the panel in the right pane.
- **Right 5**: _Transcripts within_
    - A list of all known Projects and their Transcripts in all subfolders beneath the current folder open in the middle pane.
    - The Project names are in grey and the Transcript names are highlighted on a blue background.

Note that in all panes, Transcripts (in Projects) are highlighted with a blue background.
Clicking on a Transcript will open it in _DOTE_.

### Create a new Transcript in the current Project <a id='new-transcript'></a>

1. To create a new Transcript in the _current_ Project that is open, with the same media sources available, then click on `File âž” New Transcript`.
Each project can host multiple transcripts of the same video clip(s) added with [Media Manager](media.md).
1. Give the Transcript a name.
1. Select the [conventions](conventions.md) you prefer.
You can change this in [Transcript Options](settings.md#options) later.
1. Click `Create`.

That's it! You are ready to start [transcribing](transcript.md).
